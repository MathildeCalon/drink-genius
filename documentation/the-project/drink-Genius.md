# DRINK GENIOUS: the Bar To Glass Project

It is a website that will offer mainly two features.

The first feature "classic" is a cocktail search engine based on given ingredients, using a  machine with a handle like interface. The results of this search come exclusively from a database of cocktails validated by the admin (classic cocktails like Mojito, Pina Colada, or approved random ones (made by user and or admin)).

The second feature (maybe the most important and the funniest), "random," is to generate a cocktail from random ingredients in random quantities, with the option to specify one or more ingredients chosen by the user (alcohol, soft drinks, etc.) still using a machine with a handle like interface. The logged-in user can save the generated recipe, choose a name for it, give the instruction to make it and is subject to approval by the admin.

## Examples
### Example 1: The classic feature

It's Friday, I'm finally on holidays. I don't feel like going out, but I'd like to start my holidays with a cocktail. I have at home:

* Whiskey
* Sugar
* Lemon
* Sparkling water
* Orange juice
  
I go to the "Drink Genius" app, select the ingredients I have at home, and specify the ingredient(s) that must absolutely appear. I activate the cocktail machine.

A cocktail appears (has the ingredient(s) requested + optional ingredient(s) + other ingredients that the user didn't mention in their choices): If it doesn't suit their taste, they can restart the machine:

  * 1st round:

#### Appetizer: (3 of 5 requested ingredients): l√©mon juice / Whiskey / Sugar / Bitter

  * 2nd round:
  #### Arosa: (2 of 5 ingredients): Orange juice / Cointreau (Orange peel Liqueur)

  The user, surprised by this cocktail, he didn't think about adding an egg white to the drink, and indeed have eggs in the fridge.

  * third round:
  #### <span  style='color:red'>Whiskey Sour: (3 of 5 ingredients): Whiskey / Lemon juice / white egg / sugar </span>

### User Experience:
  * Quick research on the cocktail list
  * learn a new cocktail
  * Have a good time

### Example 2: The random feature: be your ownn bartender

Marcus decides to organize a birthday party, invites about ten of his friends, and wants to have a cocktail party. He doesn't necessarily want to stay behind the bar (afterall it's his birthday); he wants to enjoy his friends while drinking cocktails (alcoholic or non-alcoholic).

He buys some spirits, liqueurs, fruit juices, fruits, decorations, etc., and sets everything out for his guests on a table.

He explains to his guests that everyone can make their own cocktails with their own ingredients using the "Drink Genius" app. They are enthusiastic about the idea of making their own drinks and the possibility of suggesting them to the website later.

### User Experience:
  * Find out a random cocktail made randomly
  * Have a good time and become a bartender for the occasion
  * Can submit his creation.
